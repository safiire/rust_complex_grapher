rust_complex_grapher
====================

This is a program which can generate two-dimensional graphs of complex valued functions.  It is written Rust 0.9pre

This is a work in progress, in order to change the equation graphed you must edit the main.rs file to change the value
of z.

I intend to read equations from the commandline and parse them in the near future.

It produces uncompressed ppm files.

Hope you can learn something from it :)
